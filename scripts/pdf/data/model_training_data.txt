'\nDESCRIPTION\nJUSTIFICATION\nSECTION TITLE\n* For completeness list all sections of the standard and indicate whether conformance is met. If a section is not applicable (N/A) an \nexplanation is needed under “justification.” Some standards include options, so similar to deviations, the option chosen needs to be \ndescribed and adequately justified as appropriate for the subject device. Explanation of all deviations or description of options \nselected when following a standard is required under “type of deviation or option selected,” “description” and “justification” on the \nreport.  More than one page may be necessary.\n'|0
